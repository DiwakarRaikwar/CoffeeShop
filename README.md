# CoffeeShop

A webpage of home, which contains the basic interface of the webpage of coffeshoop,

I tried to  make it very simple, if you want to check the code,can do so by going to .dist folder than all the information which i used in code, can be find easily

Language uses in code:
HTML
CSS
and uses a jotform to take or get input from  user all the information of user will be save in the platform jotform

Working  properly the  main code of the  file  you  will  find on  Index.html
and  the css file are coffeeshop.css
